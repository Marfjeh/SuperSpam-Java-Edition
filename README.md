# SuperSpam Java Edition
Advanced program for keypress automation.

For making SuperSpam working on Every platform and this is a great time to finally learn java.

Superspam Java edition is a side project for SuperSpam and I dont expect to take the C# version over.

It wont have every features, like the 3 engines, and maybe the engine wont be fast. the UI will be a very trimmed down version of superspam.
